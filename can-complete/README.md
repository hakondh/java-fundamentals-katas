# can-complete

The goal of this kata was to make a program that check if a 
sequence of letters could have characters filled in, and none 
taken away, to make it a complete word (which is given).
The order of the letters have to be in the same order as the
letters in the final word. 

For example:

"butl" and "beautiful" will return true. <br/>
"butlz" and "beautiful" will return false.
