# largest-difference-in-array

This program finds the greatest difference between two integers in a given array. However, there is a rule that needs to be followed: The smallest of the two integers must come before the bigger in the array. 

The program also finds all integer pairs that, added together, will get the same value as the greatest difference. However, there is also a rule for this: You can't add the current number you're looking at together with a number that is behind it in the sequence.
